# Data transfer benchmark

All relevant findings are summerized in [benchmark.ipynb](benchmark.ipynb).
To run the experiments yourself, delete the `data` directory and execute `run_all_benchmarks.sh` (takes roughly a day).
The benchmark code and script are "hacked" together and cater towards an Ubuntu 22.04 setup with the upmem SDK installed using the .deb package.
